I am a software engineer at Google Research. Before joining Google, I was a Ph.D. student at the University of Washington NeuroAI Lab advised by Prof. [Eli Shlizerman](http://faculty.washington.edu/shlizee/). My research interests are at the intersection of deep learning, computer vision and audio/music signal processing. I received M.S. in ECE at UW in 2019. Prior to that, I received a B.S. in Electrical Engineering and Computer System Engineering at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI). During my undergrad, I did research with Prof. [Wencen Wu](https://sites.google.com/a/sjsu.edu/wencen-wu/home) on control and robotics.
