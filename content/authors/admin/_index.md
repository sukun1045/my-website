I am a third-year Ph.D. student of Electrical & Computer Engineering at the University of Washington NeuroAI Lab advised by Prof. [Eli Shlizerman](http://faculty.washington.edu/shlizee/). My research interests are broadly including deep learning, computer vision, time series analysis, audio/music application, and robotics. I received M.S. in ECE at UW in 2019. Prior to that, I received a B.S. in Electrical Engineering and Computer System Engineering at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI). During my undergrad, I did research with Prof. [Wencen Wu](https://sites.google.com/a/sjsu.edu/wencen-wu/home) on control and robotics.
