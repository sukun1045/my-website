I am a second-year Ph.D. student of Electrical & Computer Engineering at the University of Washington NeuroAI Lab advised by Prof. [Eli Shlizerman](http://faculty.washington.edu/shlizee/). My research interests are broadly including deep learning, computer vision, time series analysis, audio/music application, and robotics. I received M.S. in ECE at UW in 2019. Prior to that, I received a B.S. in Electrical Engineering and Computer System Engineering at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI). During my undergrad, I did research with Prof. [Wencen Wu](https://sites.google.com/a/sjsu.edu/wencen-wu/home) on control and robotics.

NEWS (Dec 2020): A new preprint paper [Multi-Instrumentalist Net: Unsupervised Generation of Music from Body
Movements](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.03478.pdf)! Also check the [YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yo5OZKBbBh4) for more samples!

NEWS (Nov 2020): I am looking for an internship opportunity in Summer 2021. Feel free to check out my CV and directly contact me!

NEWS (Sep 2020): The paper [Audeo: Audio Generation for a Silent Performance Video](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.14348.pdf) has been accepted and it would appear in **NeurIPS 2020**!

NEWS (Aug 2020): Our [NeuroAI lab](http://faculty.washington.edu/shlizee/) is organizing a regular weekly seminar for the UW community (virtually, via zoom)! We are reading leading papers at the intersection of machine learning, AI, and computational neuroscience published in top conferences. As part of the seminar, we host speakers who are authors of these papers or work on related research. Check more details in our [Github Repo](https://github.com/shlizee/NeuroAI)! Feel free to contact us if you would like to join!
