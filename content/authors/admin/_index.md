I am a second year PhD student of Electrical & Computer Engineering at the University of Washingon NeuroAI Lab advised by Prof. Eli Shlizerman. My research interests are broadly including machine learning, computer vision, audio/music application and robotics. I receive M.S. in ECE at UW in 2019. Prior to that, I received B.S. in Electrical Engineering and Computer System Engineering at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI). During my undergrad, I did research with Prof. Wencen Wu on control and robotics.
