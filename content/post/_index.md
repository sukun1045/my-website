Our [NeuroAI lab](http://faculty.washington.edu/shlizee/) is organizing a regular weekly seminar for the UW community (virtually, via zoom)! We are reading leading papers at the intersection of machine learning, AI, and computational neuroscience published in top conferences. As part of the seminar, we host speakers who are authors of these papers or work on related research. Check more details in our [Github Repo](https://github.com/shlizee/NeuroAI)! Feel free to contact us if you would like to join!
